How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It showed the lines that were different thus easier to locate changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Easier to revert to older version that worked in case of errors

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: similar changes bulked together Cons: May be too many changes in a commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The commit is related to a particular topic

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log --stat git diff commitid1 commitid2

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Knowing you can revert to previous version and see the cause of issue

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
